# Lane detection using Python and OpenCV

## Overview

This project uses Python and OpenCV to solve the lane detection assignment for the Adaptive Robotics Minor, subject Vision, Sensors, and Perception. The goal of this assignment is to detect the lanes of a road using a camera mounted on the front of a car. The camera is mounted in such a way that the road is always in the center of the image.
